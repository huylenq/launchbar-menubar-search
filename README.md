# Launchbar Menubar search

Launchbar action for quick access to the menubar. Based on the Alfred workflow
from Ted Wise: [Menubar Search](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1993-menu-search).

## Requirements

Support for assisted device must be enabled and allowed. On OSX El Capitan (10.11) and later
this is done in the System preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Accessibility.
